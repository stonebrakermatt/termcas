# TermCAS : A CAS for your Term

**NB:** Basic features are still under construction. I am taking my time because while I want a simple, lightweight tool for my terminal, I also want a robust set of features. Otherwise this wouldn't even be worth it when I can do a quick computation in Python or whatever.

## 1. Quick Usage:
#### Running
```
git clone git@github.com:stonebrakermatt/termcas.git
cd termcas
./TermCAS
```

#### Example Input
```
1 => a = 2
2 => a + 2
OUT: 4
```

#### Quitting
```
\exit
